# Dessine-moi un mouton!

Hello everyone! :relaxed: 

**Dessine-moi un mouton!** is a game that we wrote during our university second year. That was a fairly long time ago (time flies, guys). 
We're french, so the game is in french. 

The main spirit underlying the game is that we were (still are) great fans of [*The Legend of Zelda*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda) and [*Secret of Mana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana). We also happened to be mathematicians & computer scientists, meaning that this software a bit wild & crazy. However, 'computer scientists' does not mean 'software engineers', and we did not have any lecture on software designing (seems like it's still an academic issue though); so, we learnt through our essays and our errors, but the game was not thought nor designed. it was our first large project, with a team of artists (!), and we had too many ideas that we did not know were too big for the project. And our software lectures being quite scarce & poor, we rushed into it without knowing the dragons that we would meet nor how to properly & simply defeat them. Retrospectively, the result is not that bad considering the context (we also had to play *World of Warcraft*, exams to pass, academic projects, eating crêpes, drinking apple cider, and so forth). <br> 
The goal was to be able to present the game at the ['InterENS culturelles'](https://interq.ens.fr/) ("Cultural InterENS"), which we proudly (& brokenly) did. The result can (still!) be seen here (incl. screenshots): <br>

## Intellectual Property 
 
Basically, we do not care about intellectual property. You can do whatever you like with anything in that project. 
 
However, as it seems that backward copyrighting could exist, we do have a licence to prevent that case - for uninteresting law related stuffs, please see [COPYING](COPYING) (it's an ISC licence, the most liberal licence we found out: do whatever you like with it, as long as you do not prevent ourselves or others to use it). 
 

   
## Technicalities 

First, likely, the game won't compile on your computer: too many things to make it work. And as the saying goes, 'libtool is hell'.
